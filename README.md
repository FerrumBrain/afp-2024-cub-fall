This repository contains already made tasks: intro/contains, intro/two_sum, intro/reverse, intro/lemma_below_zero. 

Intro folder contains mandatory tasks:
1. Verify `sum_inverse` (pay attention to how function `sum` is implemented)
2. Add lemma invocation and invariants to `skipping_lemma` example so that it verifies
3. Add assertions into  `pathSum` example. 
4. Add invariant into `max_segment` example. 
5. Verify `cycpattern_check` example. It introduces the concept of triggers, try to add triggers into the code and observe the changes.

In the additional folder you can find extra tasks: 
1. Verification of `append_reverse` lemma
2. Verification of `bfs` algorithm 
3. Verification of `gcd` algorithm 
4. Verification of `is_cube` check
